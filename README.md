# Documentation Summarizing the Infrastructure Setup and Configuration

## Introduction:

Overview of the infrastructure being deployed (e.g., a brief description of the VPC, subnets, EC2, and RDS setup).
Purpose and goals of the infrastructure.

**Components:**

- VPC: CIDR block, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, and route tables.
- EC2 Instance: AMI ID, instance type, security group configuration.
- RDS: Database engine, version, instance class, subnet group, security group.
- Security Groups: Description of ingress and egress rules.

**Configuration Details:**

- Explanation of the variables and inputs required (e.g., subnet CIDR blocks, instance types, database credentials).
- Outputs generated by the infrastructure (e.g., VPC ID, subnet IDs).

**Tags and Metadata:**

Details on how tags were used for organization and resource management.

**Deployment Process:**

- How to use terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to deploy.
- How to use terraform destroy to tear down the infrastructure.

2. GitHub Repositories

Create separate GitHub repositories or a monorepo structure that contains:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): All Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, module folders).
- CI/CD Pipeline Configurations: GitHub Actions YAML files for building, pushing Docker images, and deploying infrastructure.
